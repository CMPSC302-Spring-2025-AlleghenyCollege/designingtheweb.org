- **Deliverables:** Incremental updates to the website, documentation of the development process, and engagement in software engineering practices.
- **Repository:** Planning and prototyping will be done in `project1` repository. Website work will be done in branches of the course website GitHub repository.

## Sprint 3 Details

- **Key Dates:**
  - March 24th: Organizing - Identify individual tasks to complete
  - March 31st: Peer Reviews - Show your implemented tasks to your team and the lead team, and identify the remaining tasks to complete the sprint
  - April 14th: Deadline - Team presentations

- **Lead Team:** Our winning team will:
  - Manage the project board, with the communication with the teams, assigning tasks as necessary
  - Monitor teams' progress and provide feedback

  - Set up GitHub Actions (e.g., linting, checking for broken links)

- **Development Process:**
  - Create branches in the [ **updated** course website repository](https://github.com/CMPSC302-Spring-2025-AlleghenyCollege/designingtheweb.org) and work in your branches
