        <div class="content">
            <p>An introduction to the principles and applications of web design with an emphasis on understanding intercultural perspectives that arise during the design, implementation, and maintenance of responsive, modern web sites. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational methods needed to create websites that are useful to people from different cultures and nationalities. Students also investigate approaches to developing efficient, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing web sites that adhere to the international standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade web development technologies to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

                Prerequisite: CMPSC 104.

        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>The course website and Discord are the main digital channels used for communication. Students are responsible for regularly checking these platforms to ensure that important messages are not missed.</p>

        <h2>Department Policies</h2>
        <p>This course follows department policies regarding attendance, late assignment submissions, and AI use.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two weeks of missed attendance = six missed class sessions.</li>
            <li>Non-participation in class/lab activity = missed attendance mark.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Grading Contract</h2>
        <p>This course emphasizes <strong>process</strong> and <strong>growth</strong>. Your grade reflects not only assignment completion but also engagement, participation, and effort. Assignments are accompanied by formative feedback rather than traditional letter grades (except quizzes).</p>
        <p>You are encouraged to experiment and even fail — as long as the effort is authentic. Failure only occurs through lack of engagement.</p>
